The background should be a crisp white to provide a clean contrast with the logo. The logo itself should be a combination of a fork and a spoon, potentially with the fork and spoon intertwined or merged into a single shape. The logo should be a prominent feature of the header, with sufficient whitespace around it to create a sense of breathing room.\n\n**Components**\n\n* HeaderContainer (Standalone): A container element that wraps the entire header. It should have a white background and should scale to fit the width of the screen.\n* Logo (Standalone): The logo component that displays the fork-spoon icon.

The `bg-white` class sets the background color to white, `h-screen` sets the height to the full screen height, `flex` sets the display property to flex, and `justify-center` centers the content horizontally. The `w-48` and `h-48` classes set the width and height of the SVG to 48 pixels, and `mx-auto` centers it horizontally."}}]}},{"prompt":"A product card component that displays a product image, title, description, price, and average rating","response":{"model":"llama3-70b-8192","choices":[{"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"**What should the UI look like?**\n\nThe UI should be a clean and modern product card that showcases the product image, title, description, price, and average rating.
