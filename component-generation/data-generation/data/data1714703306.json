The circle should be a bright accent color to draw the user's attention. The animation should be smooth and continuous, with a consistent speed. The component should be responsive, scaling down on smaller screens while maintaining its circular shape.\n\n**What are the individual components that make up the UI?**\n\n* `LoadingSpinner` (Standalone): A spinning circle loading animation with a subtle fade-in effect.\n\n**What does the HTML for the top level UI look like?**\n```html\n<div class=\"flex justify-center h-screen\">\n  <LoadingSpinner />\n</div>\n```\n**What is the HTML for each component?**\n\n* `LoadingSpinner` (Standalone):\n```html\n<div\n  class=\"animate-spin rounded-full border-[3px] border-solid border-gray-200 border-t-transparent w-12 h-12 mx-auto\"\n>\n  <span class=\"sr-only\">Loading...</span>\n</div>\n```\nIn this solution, I've used Tailwind CSS to style the loading spinner. The `animate-spin` class creates the spinning animation, while `rounded-full` and `border-[3px]` create the circular shape. The `border-gray-200` and `border-t-transparent` classes create the loading effect by making the top border transparent and the rest of the border gray. The `w-12` and `h-12` classes set the width and height of the spinner to 12 units. The `mx-auto` class centers the spinner horizontally. Finally, the `sr-only` class hides the \"Loading...\" text from sighted users while keeping it accessible to screen readers."}}]}},{"prompt":"Image cards with a soft, rounded corner and a 1-pixel border","response":{"model":"llama3-70b-8192","choices":[{"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"**What should the UI look like?**\n\nThe UI should feature a grid of image cards with a soft, rounded corner and a 1-pixel border.
