The `Array(5).fill(0).map` code generates an array of 5 elements, which are then mapped over to render 5 star icons. The `cursor-pointer` class makes the star icons clickable, and the `text-yellow-400` and `text-gray-400` classes style the selected and unselected stars, respectively."}}]}},{"prompt":"Hero section with a background image of a popular game, overlaid with white text and neon green highlights","response":{"model":"llama3-70b-8192","choices":[{"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"**What should the UI look like?**\n\nThe hero section should have a high-quality background image of a popular game, such as a landscape from The Last of Us or a cityscape from Cyberpunk 2077.
