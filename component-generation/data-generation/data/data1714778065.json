The map marker icon should be a colorful, eye-catching element that stands out from the rest of the list. On smaller screens, the icon should be smaller to accommodate the limited screen real estate. On larger screens, the icon can be larger and more prominent.\n\n**2. What are the individual components that make up the UI?**\n\n* `EventLocationIcon` (Standalone): A map marker icon that indicates an event location. On small screens, the icon should be 16x16px. On medium screens and up, the icon should be 24x24px.\n* `EventListItem` (Takes Children): A list item that contains an event's information, including the event name, location, and date. On small screens, the list item should take up the full width of the screen. On medium screens and up, the list item should be limited to a maximum width of 600px.\n\n**3.
