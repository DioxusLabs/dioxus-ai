It should have a subtle gradient background to give it some depth. The links should be spaced out evenly and have a slight hover effect to indicate interactivity. On smaller screens, the menu items should stack on top of each other for easy navigation.\n\n**2.

The `bg-gradient-to-r` class adds a gradient background, `p-4` adds padding, `flex` and `justify-between` classes are used to distribute the navigation links evenly, and `text-lg` and `text-gray-600` are used to style the text. The `hover:text-gray-900` class adds a hover effect, and `transition` classes are used to animate the hover effect."}}]}},{"prompt":"A small icon component to represent different types of activities (e.g. hiking, beach, city)","response":{"model":"llama3-70b-8192","choices":[{"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Here is the design and HTML for a small icon component:\n\n**What should the UI look like?**\nThe icon component should be small, colorful, and easily recognizable.
