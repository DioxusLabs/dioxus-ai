I've also used the `shadow-sm` class to add a subtle shadow effect."}}]}},{"prompt":"Footer with a black background, social media links, and copyright information","response":{"model":"llama3-70b-8192","choices":[{"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Here is the design and HTML for a footer component:\n\n**What should the UI look like?**\nThe footer should have a black background, with social media links and copyright information in white text.
